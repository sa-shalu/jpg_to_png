I understand your request. Here's a breakdown of the code into meaningful sections:

## Import necessary modules:

~~~python
import sys
import os
from PIL import Image
~~~

This section imports the required modules for the script:
sys: For accessing command-line arguments.
os: For interacting with the file system.
PIL: For image processing.
## Get input and output directories:

~~~Python
path = sys.argv[1]
directory = sys.argv[2]
~~~

This section retrieves the input and output directories from the command-line arguments.
## Create output directory (if needed):

~~~Python
if not os.path.exists(directory):
    os.makedirs(directory)
~~~
This section checks if the output directory exists and creates it if necessary.
## Process images:

~~~Python
for filename in os.listdir(path):
    img = Image.open(f"{path}/{filename}")
    clean_name = os.path.splitext(filename)[0]
    img.save(f"{directory}/{clean_name}.png")   

~~~

This section iterates through each image file in the input directory:
Opens the image using Image.open().
Extracts the filename without the extension.
Saves the image as a PNG file in the output directory.
## Print completion message:

~~~Python
print('all done')
~~~

This section prints a message indicating that the conversion is complete.
## How to use code

Save the code as a Python file (e.g., image_converter.py).

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

Run the script using the following command:   

~~~Bash
python image_converter.py input_directory output_directory
~~~

Replace input_directory with the actual path to the directory containing the images you want to convert, and replace output_directory with the path to the directory where you want the converted PNG images to be saved.
